#### Currently in minor hiatus

For future users or commiters of and to this theme, I am not actively working on this project. I still review pull requests from others when they are made, but I may not find the time right away. The current - and possibly outdated - list of things that I know need to be done are in the [TODO](https://github.com/Sclarki/neonwave.vim/blob/master/TODO) list.

## Installation
You may install this with [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim) as you would any other plugin. If you don't use Vundle, you may instead just stick the ```neonwave.vim``` file in your colors directory and set your highlight to it in your vimrc with ```colorscheme neonwave```.
