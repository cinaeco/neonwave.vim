Try to make the colour file look ... better. More organised.

Add colours for the following:

* DiffAdd
* DiffChange
* DiffDelete
* DiffText
* Ignore
* SpellCap     # YCM says this is also for YcmWarningSection,
               # but I do not extensively use YCM to notice where this lies.
* SpellRare
* SpellLocal
* WildMenu
* VisualNOS
* 
* MatchParen   # This one exists, however I'm not *quite* sure how I want it.
