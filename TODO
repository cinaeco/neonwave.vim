Everything that needs doing at some point is listed here.

* Determine accuracy of Japanese text translations in the README
* Organise the file of colour specs to be less (or more) crazy
* Adjust the GUI colours so they look appropriate for full colour support and not a bad mock-up


Add colours for:

* DiffAdd
* DiffChange
* DiffDelete
* DiffText
* Ignore
* SpellCap     # YCM says this is also for YcmWarningSection,
               # but I do not extensively use YCM to notice where this lies.
* SpellRare
* SpellLocal
* WildMenu
* VisualNOS
* 
* MatchParen   # This one exists, however I'm not *quite* sure how I want it.
